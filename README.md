# MATLAB-Plant-Watering-Project
This repository contains the MATLAB code for a plant watering project using an Arduino Grove Beginner Kit and a MOSFET switch. The code measures the voltage of the soil of a plant, and determines whether the plant needs water or not. This project includes a README file with instructions on how to use the code.
