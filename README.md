# MATLAB-Plant-Watering-Project
This project is a simulation of watering a plant using an Arduino Uno board, a soil sensor, a MOSFET switch, and a water pump. The MATLAB code measures the voltage of the plant's soil and determines whether the plant needs watering based on a set threshold.

# Getting Started
To complete this project, you will need to have the following components:

* MATLAB software
* Arduino Uno board
* MOSFET switch
* Soil sensor
* Water pump
* Cup to hold water
* Micro USB to USB-A cable
* 9V battery

For instructions on how to set up the hardware components, refer to the annotated setup picture in the repository. Once the components are set up, connect the Arduino board to your computer/PC using the micro USB to USB-A cable, open the MATLAB code in the MATLAB software, and run the code.

Make sure to stop the code manually when you are done simulating the watering of the plant.
